# Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict customer churn. Customer churn, or attrition, is a critical problem for businesses across various sectors (telecom, banking, subscription services) as it directly impacts revenue and growth. By identifying customers at high risk of churning, businesses can implement proactive retention strategies, such as targeted offers, personalized support, or service improvements, to reduce customer loss.

This repository provides a comprehensive solution covering data exploration, preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

## Business Problem

Customer churn represents a significant financial drain for businesses. Acquiring new customers is often far more expensive than retaining existing ones. Predicting churn allows companies to:
- **Proactively intervene:** Offer incentives or support to at-risk customers.
- **Optimize marketing spend:** Target retention efforts more effectively.
- **Improve customer satisfaction:** Understand root causes of dissatisfaction.
- **Enhance product/service offerings:** Identify features or aspects leading to churn.

Our goal is to build a predictive model that accurately identifies potential churners, enabling timely and cost-effective retention initiatives.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project contains various customer attributes, service usage patterns, and their churn status.
*(**Note:** Replace with actual dataset details once chosen, e.g., "The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's 'Telco Customer Churn' dataset, which includes customer demographics, service subscriptions, and monthly charges.")*

## Project Structure
This is a fantastic request! Creating a full source code example with a README and requirements.txt will provide a complete, runnable, and presentable project.

Given the complexity and length, I'll provide a structured response, with placeholders for specific dataset details you'd choose.

## Key Stages & Technologies

1.  **Data Acquisition & Loading:** Loading the customer churn dataset.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Understanding data distributions, identifying correlations.
    * Visualizing churn patterns based on different features (e.g., tenure, contract type, monthly charges).
    * Checking for missing values and outliers.
    * **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
3.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Handling missing values (imputation or removal).
    * Encoding categorical variables (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).
    * Feature Scaling for numerical features (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler).
    * **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features (e.g., `tenure_group`, `total_charges`).
    * Handling Imbalanced Data: Techniques like `SMOTE` (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address the typical imbalance where non-churners far outnumber churners.
    * **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn.preprocessing`, `imblearn.over_sampling`
4.  **Model Selection & Implementation:**
    * **Baseline Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
    * **Ensemble Models:** Gradient Boosting Machines known for excellent performance on tabular data.
        * XGBoost (`xgboost`)
        * LightGBM (`lightgbm`)
    * **Libraries:** `sklearn.linear_model`, `sklearn.tree`, `sklearn.ensemble`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`
5.  **Model Evaluation:**
    * **Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC curve. These are crucial for imbalanced datasets common in churn prediction.
    * **Tools:** Confusion Matrix, Classification Report.
    * **Libraries:** `sklearn.metrics`
6.  **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identifying which features contribute most significantly to churn prediction to gain actionable insights.
    * **Libraries:** `sklearn.ensemble`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`
7.  **Threshold Optimization:** Adjusting the classification threshold to balance precision and recall based on specific business objectives (e.g., prioritizing recall to capture more churners, even if it means more false positives).

## How to Run the Project

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction-ml.git](https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction-ml.git)
    cd customer-churn-prediction-ml
    ```
2.  **Place Dataset:**
    * Download your chosen churn dataset (e.g., from Kaggle).
    * Place it in the `data/` directory. Name it appropriately (e.g., `telecom_churn.csv`).
    *(**Note:** Update this instruction with the actual dataset download link if available, or just mention the type of dataset and common source like Kaggle.)*
3.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
6.  **Open and Run the Notebook:** Navigate to `notebooks/churn_prediction_eda_modeling.ipynb` and run all cells sequentially.

## Actionable Insights & Retention Strategies

Based on the analysis (detailed in the Jupyter Notebook and summarized here), we can derive insights to inform retention efforts:

* **Contract Type:** Customers on month-to-month contracts often exhibit higher churn rates. **Strategy:** Offer incentives (discounts, bonus data) for signing longer-term contracts (e.g., 1-year or 2-year).
* **Monthly Charges:** High monthly charges without perceived value can lead to churn. **Strategy:** Segment customers by usage and offer tiered plans or personalized packages.
* **Tenure:** New customers (low tenure) and long-term customers might churn for different reasons. **Strategy:** Implement robust onboarding programs for new customers and loyalty programs for long-term customers.
* **Service Issues:** Specific services (e.g., Fiber Optic internet, Tech Support, Streaming TV) might be correlated with churn. **Strategy:** Investigate service quality issues in these areas, improve customer support channels for these services.
* **Payment Method:** Certain payment methods could be correlated with churn. **Strategy:** Investigate reasons (e.g., billing issues, ease of payment).

*(**Note:** These are generic examples. The actual insights will depend on your chosen dataset and analysis.)*
